# Portfolio_Website

This is a simple portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can download it and use it as-is or make changes to customize it according to your preferences.

### Project Structure

The project is organized into the following files:

* **Profile.html**: The main landing page of the portfolio website.
* **Profile.css**: The stylesheet that controls the design and layout of the website.
* **Script.js**: JavaScript file to add interactivity (e.g., animations, event handling).
* **Data**: Folder containing images and icons used in the website.

### Usage

**Download and Open Locally:**

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `Profile.html` file directly in your browser or use the "Go Live" option in VS Code to view it.
3. Customize the design, content, and layout as per your requirements.

**Customization:**

1. Edit the content in the `Profile.html` file to update your portfolio details.
2. Modify the styles in `Profile.css` to change the design (colors, fonts, etc.).
3. Use the `Script.js` file to add interactive features or functionality.

### How it works

- **HTML (Profile.html):** The structure and content of the website, including headings, images, and links.
- **CSS (Profile.css):** The styling of the website, including layout, colors, fonts, and other design elements.
- **JavaScript (Script.js):** Adds interactivity like animations or dynamic content (if any).

### Notes

* The website is fully responsive for desktop devices. To ensure optimal display on mobile devices, further adjustments can be made. A separate mobile responsiveness file will be provided in future updates to streamline this process.
* You can easily modify the sections such as **About Me**, **Projects**, and **Contact** based on your personal information.

**To improve or expand your portfolio further:**

* The website is fully responsive for desktop devices. To enhance mobile compatibility, additional adjustments can be made.
* Add more sections such as blogs or testimonials.
* Integrate external libraries or frameworks (like Bootstrap, jQuery).
* Customize animations and transitions for a smoother user experience.

This project is designed as a starting point for anyone looking to create a personal portfolio website. Feel free to modify and make it your own!
